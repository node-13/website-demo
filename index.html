        <p>Hello, world! Welcome to Narked Divers, where true crime meets the deep blue. My name is Trey Lombardo, and my journey into the world of emergency services began at a very young age. By the age of 8, I was responding to my first fire call alongside my uncle.</p>
        <p>In 2009, I started as a junior firefighter, eventually becoming a paid on-call firefighter, a diver for my local sheriff's office, an operations specialist for my county's emergency management, a 911 communicator, and working in various public safety roles. However, my true calling has always been the water, where I can make the most significant impact.</p>
        <p>Join me as we dive deep into the mysteries of missing persons cases and evidence recovery. Here at Narked Divers, we're not just solving crimes; we're bringing closure to families and uncovering the secrets hidden beneath the surface. We also focus on cleaning up our environment by removing trash from our waterways and conducting salvage operations to remove boats, vehicles, and other debris from the water.</p>
        <p>So gear up and get ready to explore the unknown.</p>
